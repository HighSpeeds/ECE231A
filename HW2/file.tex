\subsection*{(a)}
Let the increase in Alice's score after the ith round be 
represented by the random variable $Z_A^i$ we have that
\begin{align*}
    Z_A^i&=\begin{cases}
        4 & \text{w.p. } 1/15\\
        7 & \text{w.p. } 5/15\\
        0 & \text{w.p. } 9/15
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
And the increase in Bob's score after the ith round be
represented by the random variable $Z_B^i$ we have that
\begin{align*}
    Z_B^i&=\begin{cases}
        3 & \text{w.p. } 1/15\\
        5 & \text{w.p. } 2/15\\
        6 & \text{w.p. } 6/15\\
        0 & \text{w.p. } 6/15
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
Then we have that 
$$S_A^n=\sum_{i=1}^n Z_A^i$$
and
$$S_B^n=\sum_{i=1}^n Z_B^i$$
As $n\to\infty$ we have that
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}S_A^n=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n Z_A^i=E[Z_A^i]=\boxed{2.6}$$
and
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}S_B^n=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n Z_B^i=E[Z_B^i]=\boxed{3.225}$$
\subsection*{(b)}
We will need to make $\alpha>7$ since we need to increase the expected value,
therefore the probabilites for $Z_A$ would not change, however instead 
of being 7 with the probability of $5/15$ we would have $\alpha$ with the
probability of $5/15$. Likewise $Z_B$ would not change. Therefore we would have that
our new 
$$E[Z_A^i]=\frac{4}{15}+\frac{5}{15}\alpha$$
To make this greater than $3.225$ we would have that
$\alpha>8.875$, so the least value of alpha to make Alice's
score greater than Bob's after n rounds is $\boxed{\alpha=9}$ if $\alpha$ has
to be an integer.
